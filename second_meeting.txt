Meeting Notes:
-Sections can be a guideline for the group, divide however we see fit. (Dialogue, combat, enemies, etc...)
-Keep it simple for now, just to get the code started for the game.
-Keep it four levels? (team can weigh in on this one, 3-4 might keep it simple for now)
-The club might meet again around when school starts, possibly have a meeting where we can all get to work on the project in person together. (possible)
